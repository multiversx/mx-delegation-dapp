### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

The dapp is a client side only poject and is built using the Create React App scripts.

Follow the next step to start using this dapp or follow the next tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkjUmBsmQYM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=ElrondNetwork)

### Prerequisites

For _development_ you will need to have the following:

- node version 14.17.6
- npm

### Instalation and running

### Step 1. Install modules

From a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`

### Step 2. Update Configs

In the application's src folder there are 3 config files (config.devnet.ts, config.testnet.ts, config.mainnet.ts).

Based on the environment used the configs will need to be updated:

- delegationContract : should contain the address of the Delegation Smart Contract received after the creation of Delegation Smart Contract
- also check the walletAddress, apiAddress and explorerAddress

### Step 3. Create .env file

- copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- leave as it is to deploy on a root domain e.g. `staking.yourcompany.com` or add path e.g. `PUBLIC_URL=/staking/` if you wish to deploy the app in a subfolder.

### Step 4. Build for testing and production use

A build of the app is necessary to deploy for testing purposes or for production use.
The dapp is configured with build scripts targeting either the public devnet, the public testnet or the public mainnet.

For testing on the devnet run => `npm run build-devnet`

For testing on the testnet run => `npm run build-testnet`

For production use on the mainnet run => `npm run build-mainnet`

### Step 5. Run the dashboard

To run the project locally run `npm run start` from the project folder. This will start the React app in development mode, using the configs found in the config.ts file.
